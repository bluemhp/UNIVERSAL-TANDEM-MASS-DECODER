The concept of the program is iteratively searching for potential intervals between MS/MS signals from a tandem mass spectrum that is corresponding to the code 0 or 1, and transforms codes to text or image. 

The program provides an UI and it consists of 4 windows: parameter setting window, code to text window, code to image window, and incorrectly recognized window.
